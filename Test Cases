What if user enters capital letter as one of guesses for the letter?
  - counts it as a mistake
  - convert to letter input to lower case

After user is done guessing the word, it keeps allowing them to enter letters as long as mistake count < 6
  - allow user to enter input only as long as mistakes < 6 AND there are _ left in the spaces
  
What if user enters category name with dif caps?
  - use ignore case and just focus on word
 
What if user enters a player number other than 1 or 2? Similar to choosing category.
  - was not able to fix because if player_num was in try-catch, it was not accesible outside
  
When you enter more than 1 letter as a guess
  - program only takes first letter

GRAPHICS unable to be called

PLAYER 2 unable to map letters to spaces

When you enter a letter that repeats in the word it only replaces the first occurence
