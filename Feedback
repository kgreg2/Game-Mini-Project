- if the letter guessed was incorrect, then restate the inputed letter when outputting the message so that they can avoid repeating the same letter
- if they guess a letter which is not in the word, tell the user how many incorrect guesses they have left until the game is over.
- print a  congrats message with the amount of tries they took, and maybe keep track of time as well. Also give the user a score which depends on how many guesses they took, how many were incorrect, and the diffculty of the word. 
- make the entire game a function so that you can recall it at the end of the game if the user wants to play again.
- add spaces between the underscores for clarity.
- at the end of the game, ouput all the letter which they guessed that were incorrect.
